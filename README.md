## Project Overview

This project aims to detect fraudulent transactions in credit card data using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The dataset used for this project is highly imbalanced, so we applied random oversampling to balance it. 

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is publicly available on Kaggle: [Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud).

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Standardized the data.
   - Addressed the class imbalance using random oversampling.

2. **Modeling**:
   - Built an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) using TensorFlow and Keras.
   - Trained the model on the balanced dataset.

3. **Evaluation**:
   - Achieved a training set accuracy of 99.95%.
   - Achieved a validation set accuracy of 99.95%.
   - Achieved a test set accuracy of 99.96%.

## Results

The ANN model shows outstanding performance in detecting fraudulent transactions with high accuracy across training, validation, and test sets.

- **Training Accuracy**: 99.95%
- **Validation Accuracy**: 99.95%
- **Test Accuracy**: 99.96%
