## ✨ Project Overview

The Credit Card Fraud Detection project aims to identify fraudulent transactions in credit card data using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). Given the highly imbalanced nature of the dataset, random oversampling was employed to balance it.

## 🌟 Features

### 🔍 Data Preprocessing
- **Standardization**: The dataset was standardized to ensure uniformity.
- **Oversampling**: Random oversampling was used to address class imbalance, making the model more effective in detecting fraud.

### 🧠 Model Development
- **ANN Construction**: Built an Artificial Neural Network using TensorFlow and Keras.
- **Training**: The model was trained on the balanced dataset to improve detection accuracy.

### 📈 Model Evaluation
- **Training Accuracy**: Achieved a high training accuracy of 99.95%.
- **Validation Accuracy**: Achieved a validation accuracy of 99.95%.
- **Test Accuracy**: Achieved a test accuracy of 99.96%.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language for the project.
- **TensorFlow**: Framework used for building and training the neural network.
- **Keras**: API used for constructing the ANN.
- **scikit-learn**: Utilized for data preprocessing and model evaluation.
- **Numpy**: Employed for numerical operations.
- **Pandas**: Used for data manipulation and analysis.

## 📋 How It Works

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Standardize the data and apply random oversampling to balance the dataset.
2. **Model Training**: Construct and train the ANN model using the processed dataset.
3. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's performance on training, validation, and test datasets.
